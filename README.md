This repository provides Python code to run infinite-armed bandit algorithms in non-stationary/rotting synthetic environments. It provides the code to reproduce the experimental results of the paper [Tracking Most Significant Shifts in Infinite-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00108) by Joe Suk and Jung-hun Kim.

To run experiments:
```python
run python3 main_multi.py
```
